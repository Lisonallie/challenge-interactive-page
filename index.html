        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Big open skies are a wonderful feature of our countryside and on a clear night you can see over 4,000 stars
            sparkling in our universe. So, why not follow Galileo Galilei's footsteps?
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me for a short stroll on level paths on Sussex's highest point to explore the night sky. Away from the
            light pollution of nearby towns, Black Downâ€™s sweeping skies and unspoilt, expansive views across five
            counties make it an ideal spot for observing the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
            As well as hearing the churring of Nightjars and seeing Pippestrelle bats hunting insects, we should see the
            Milky Way, the Summer Triangle and Polaris before the star of the evening arrives- the Perseid meteor
            shower. Tonight they are at their peak, sending 60 or more shooting stars per hour across the night sky.
            With a favourable Moon, we should be in for quite a show. It's visible with the naked eye, it's amazing and
            it's free!

        <h2>Practical Info</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>when : Saturday 3 August, 8PM to Sunday 4 August 1:30 AM 2019,
            <li>
            <li>
                Things to bring: A torch, preferably with a red filter (this can be bodged up from sweet wrappers).
                Something to sit/lay on- a reclined position will offer the best views and greatest comfort. Binoculars.
                A blanket. Hot drink(s)
            </li>
            <li>
                What to wear: Warm clothes- layer up, it can get chilly late on. Sturdy footwear- while we'll arrive and
                get in position just before sunset, it will obviously be dark when we finish and difficult to see firm
                footholds. The round trip from car park to viewing site and back is about a mile
            </li>
            <li>
                How to find the car park: Head out of Haslemere on B2131, turn right up Haste Hill, follow onto
                Tennyson's Lane and head south-west until you come to the main car park. Turn right immediately after
                this car park, up an unsealed road, and there's a small car park on your right
            </li>
