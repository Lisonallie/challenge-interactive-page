    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Big open skies are a wonderful feature of our countryside and on a clear night you can see over 4,000 stars
        sparkling in our universe. So, why not follow Galileo Galilei's footsteps?
    </p>
    <p>
        Join me for a short stroll on level paths on Sussex's highest point to explore the night sky. Away from the
        light pollution of nearby towns, Black Downâ€™s sweeping skies and unspoilt, expansive views across five
        counties make it an ideal spot for observing the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
        As well as hearing the churring of Nightjars and seeing Pippestrelle bats hunting insects, we should see the
        Milky Way, the Summer Triangle and Polaris before the star of the evening arrives- the Perseid meteor
        shower. Tonight they are at their peak, sending 60 or more shooting stars per hour across the night sky.
        With a favourable Moon, we should be in for quite a show. It's visible with the naked eye, it's amazing and
        it's free!

    <h2>Practical Info</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="pi">When :</span>  Saturday 3 August, 8PM to Sunday 4 August 1:30 AM 2019</li>
        <li>
            <span class="pi">Things to bring :</span> A torch, preferably with a red filter (this can be bodged up from sweet wrappers).
            Something to sit/lay on- a reclined position will offer the best views and greatest comfort. Binoculars.
            A blanket. Hot drink(s)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="pi">What to wear :</span> Warm clothes- layer up, it can get chilly late on. Sturdy footwear- while we'll arrive and
            get in position just before sunset, it will obviously be dark when we finish and difficult to see firm
            footholds. The round trip from car park to viewing site and back is about a mile
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="pi">How to find the car park :</span> Head out of Haslemere on B2131, turn right up Haste Hill, follow onto
            Tennyson's Lane and head south-west until you come to the main car park. Turn right immediately after
            this car park, up an unsealed road, and there's a small car park on your right
